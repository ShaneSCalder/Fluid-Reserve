## Repository Overview

This repository provides the building blocks and examples needed to get started with the Q-Learning Meta Stack for time-series predictions. While the repository does not include the Q-learning environment itself due to our IP restrictions, it offers comprehensive guidance on training and simulating data using Monte Carlo analysis and historical data.

### Contents

- **Monte Carlo Analysis**: Techniques to generate and analyze simulated data for robust model training.
- **Historical Data Handling**: Methods to leverage historical data for model training and validation.
- **Simulated Data Generation**: Tools to create simulated datasets for various time-series scenarios.
- **Agent Results and Storage**: Save and utilize trained agents for future training and prediction tasks.
- **Training Models**: Instructions to train multiple models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and LSTMs.

## Getting Started

To get started with building your own Q-Learning Meta Stack and utilizing the provided examples:

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Dependencies**: Install the necessary Python packages using the following command:
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Training and Simulation

2. **Historical Data Utilization**: Learn how to incorporate historical data into your training process.
3. **Training Models**: Follow the examples to train Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and LSTM models.

### Example Usage

Below is an example of how to train a Random Forest model using the provided scripts:

```python
import pandas as pd
from models.random_forest import train_random_forest

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('data/historical_data.csv')

# Train the Random Forest model
model = train_random_forest(data)

# Save the trained model
model.save('models/random_forest_model.pkl')
```

### Future Work

While this repository provides the foundational elements, future work involves integrating a Q-learning environment to dynamically select and employ these trained models in real-time data prediction scenarios.
